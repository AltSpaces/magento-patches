# Magento 1 Patch and Tools Archive

*Magento 1 OEM support was concluded on June 30th, 2020, and the code, documentation, and patches were removed from magento.com shortly thereafter. This resource exists for the benefit of sites still running legacy Magento 1 installations and for those interested in the history and evolution of Magento code and security over time.*

*The patches and tools are offered without any claim of suitability or warranty. It is the responsibility of all merchants to take necessary steps to ensure their own security and regulatory compliance. [Additional resources for Magento 1 merchants post-EOL may be found at the Commerce Co-Op](https://www.magentoassociation.org/commerce-co-op/full-article/magento-1-post-eol-resources-1).*

*Thanks to [Brent Peterson](https://twitter.com/brentwpeterson) of [Wagento](https://www.wagento.com/) for the creation and maintenance of this resource. Issues and questions should be directed to [the canonical repository](https://github.com/brentwpeterson/magento-patches).*
